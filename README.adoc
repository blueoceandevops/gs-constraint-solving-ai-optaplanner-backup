This guide walks you through the process of creating a https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot]
application with https://www.optaplanner.org/[OptaPlanner]'s constraint solving Artificial Intelligence.

== What you'll build

You'll build a REST application that optimizes a school timetable for students and teachers:

Your service will assign `Lesson` instances to `Timeslot` and `Room` instances automatically,
using AI to adhere to hard and soft scheduling _constraints_, such as:

* A room can have at most one lesson at the same time.
* A teacher can teach at most one lesson at the same time.
* A student can attend at most one lesson at the same time.
* A teacher prefers to teach in a single room.
* A teacher prefers to teach sequential lessons and dislikes gaps between lessons.

Mathematically speaking, school timetabling is an _NP-hard_ problem.
That means it's difficult.
Simply brute force iterating through all possible combinations takes millions of years.
On a supercomputer. For a small dataset.
Luckily, a constraint solver like OptaPlanner uses more advanced algorithms.

== The build file and the dependencies

Use https://start.spring.io/[Spring Initializr] to generate an application
with the following dependencies:

* Spring Web (`spring-boot-starter-web`)
* OptaPlanner (`optaplanner-spring-boot-starter`)

If you choose Maven, your `pom.xml` looks like this:

[source,xml,tabsize=2]
----
include::initial/pom.xml[]
----

On the other hand, in Gradle your `build.gradle` resembles this:

[source,groovy,tabsize=2]
----
include::initial/build.gradle[]
----

== Model the domain objects

// TODO

`src/main/java/com/example/domain/Timeslot.java`
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::initial/src/main/java/com/example/domain/Timeslot.java[]
----

`src/main/java/com/example/domain/Room.java`
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::initial/src/main/java/com/example/domain/Room.java[]
----

`src/main/java/com/example/domain/Lesson.java`
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::initial/src/main/java/com/example/domain/Lesson.java[]
----


== Create the planning solution

// TODO

`src/main/java/com/example/domain/TimeTable.java`
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::initial/src/main/java/com/example/domain/TimeTable.java[]
----


== Define the hard and soft constraints

// TODO

`src/main/java/com/example/solver/TimeTableConstraintProvider.java`
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::initial/src/main/java/com/example/solver/TimeTableConstraintProvider.java[]

== Create the solver service

// TODO

`src/main/java/com/example/solver/TimeTableService.java`
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::initial/src/main/java/com/example/solver/TimeTableController.java[]
----



== Make the application executable

Package everything in a single, executable JAR file, driven by a good old Java `main()` method:

`src/main/java/com/example/TimeTableSpringBootApp.java`
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::initial/src/main/java/com/example/TimeTableSpringBootApp.java[]
----

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/spring-boot-application.adoc[]

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/build_an_executable_jar_subhead.adoc[]

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/build_an_executable_jar_with_both.adoc[]


// TODO



== Test the application

// TODO
Now that the application is running, you can test it.



== Summary

// TODO
Congratulations! You've just developed a https://spring.io/[Spring] application with https://www.optaplanner.org/[OptaPlanner]!
